# What MIT gets wrong about Using Zotero with LaTeX and BibTeX

You're probably here because you visited the mit.edu page on [Zotero at MIT: Zotero with LaTeX and
BibTeX](http://libguides.mit.edu/c.php?g=176000&p=1159208), and you want to learn about the [Better
BibTeX](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/wiki) utility that page linked to. If you want to find out what
Better BibTeX can do for you, you can visit the
[documentation](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/wiki), but if you just want to download Better BibTeX
for Zotero, you can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/releases/latest).

The MIT page contains some omissions however that could unnecessarily scare you away from using Zotero for your Bib(La)TeX
needs. The MIT librarians seem to be actively hostile to this being pointed out, which is why I've put up this page. On
this page, I assume you're open to using Better BibTeX to address these problems -- if not, you probably would not be
here, right? Onwards then. The headers below match the relevant section of the [MIT
page](http://libguides.mit.edu/c.php?g=176000&p=1159208) to explain what I think could be reformulated.

## How do I export from Zotero to BibTeX?

The points below will assume you will use the 'Better BibTeX' format rather than the 'BibTeX' format as the MIT page
instructs.

## How can I fix references that had problems formatting special characters?

Not even the standard BibTeX exporter from Zotero makes these entirely basic mistakes anymore, so I have no idea why
this is still up there. Still, there *are* some LaTeX constructs that Zotero does not export well (although not the ones
that the MIT page points out -- mostly very esoteric math symbols). Better BibTeX however does, and if you ever find an
exception, I very much welcome [bug reports](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/issues) so I can get
that corrected. I haven't had bug reports like these in ages though. Better BibTeX has quite comprehensive coverage when
it comes to translating references to correct BibTeX.

## How can I make an organization name display correctly?

It doesn't look like the MIT librarians have ever used Zotero. You can toggle author fields in Zotero between two-part
and single-part names by clicking the icon to the right of the author name. Single-part author names are written out
properly quoted automatically. This is not something you need or want to by hand. You don't even need Better BibTeX for
this, or BibTeX at all for all that matter -- single-part names (which are approriate for institutions or authors which
are only ever referred to by a single name, such as Aristotle) is just supported functionality of Zotero even if you use
the Word/OpenOffice plugins. To add insult to injury, the unnecesary "fix" proposed by the MIT librarians, to be
performed manually *every time* you export your references, is actually not a fix at all but a source of problems in its own
right -- see the next point.

## How can I override BibTeX capitalization conventions?

Again, the MIT librarians are making unwarranted assumptions here about what Zotero writes out *and* are suggesting a
"solution" that is actually as bad as the problem it sets out to solve. The proper way to prevent

> title={IEE Proceedings}

to be turned into

> Iee proceedings

when your document is compiled is **not** to encode it as the MIT librarians suggest using

> title="{IEE Proceedings}"

but rather

> title=\{\{IEE\} Proceedings\}

The "solution" suggested by the MIT librarians does indeed prevent BibTeX from meddling with your capitalization, except
some citation styles *demand* that they are able to do this -- some styles demand that that title would become

> IEE proceedings

and the MIT "solution" prevents this. You only want to protect those exact *parts* that you want to exclude from this
process, and guess what: *Zotero already does this* for words containing uppercase letters, so once again, the MIT
librarians are offering a broken solution to a non-problem.

In the case of Better BibTeX, it will even do this for non-ASCII capital letters like `Ã‘`, and it handles a number of
edge cases that the standard Zotero BibTeX doesn't handle (for example when there italics or superscript bits in your
title -- this is devilishly complex, and I don't fault Zotero for opting for a simpler translator when most references
don't need these features). If there are some parts where you want to keep something lowercased regardless of the
BibTeX style you chose, you can wrap that part in `<span class="nocase">....</span>` and whatever's between them will be
excluded from case-changing. This is formally supported in Zotero and will work for BibTeX but also if you're using your
references in Word/LibreOffice/etc.

Again, you do not need or want to make this change (manually or otherwise) every time you export to BibTeX when Zotero is perfectly
capable of doing this for you. The rules governing such are complex, and Better BibTeX will handle the complexity
on your behalf if you will just let it.

Or maybe you get extra points at MIT for doing references in unnecessarily clunky ways using very old and outdated
versions of Zotero/Better BibTeX. But in that case I'd suggest just upgrading Zotero/Better BibTeX and lying to the
librarians that you followed their recommendations, and use the extra time so gained to making your killer thesis
argument even better.
